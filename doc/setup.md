# Requirements

* a Ruby/Rack web application environment (such as
[Passenger](http://www.modrails.com/))

* Ruby gem dependencies (see the gemspec)

* [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/)

You will most likely need a dedicated or virtual private server to run
MongoDB as most shared hosting does not support it. See the lightweight front
end document for how host the static HTML/CSS/Javascript only and use
memecaptain.com for the backend.
